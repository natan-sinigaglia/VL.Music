Add your own SCALES in the folder, 
the notation is based on intervals between notes,
from root to root + 1 oct.
Maximum 12 intervals per scale, no microtonal stuff for the moment ;)

In the CHORDS folder are the reference intervals used to compare. 
Divided in pairs, three note and four note chords.

I am not sure if all the four note chords in the file are right, and it is far to be complete.

it would be more efficient and easier to scale, to do that based on rules, but for the moment it does the job.

Five Note chords and so on are not implemented, waiting for a better chord finder system.

When Assistant is off and some notes are played simultaneously along the same scale, the chord finder tries to find the chord name.

Bugs:
Filter does not work right, when base note is different to C

To do:
redo the data structure
redo the ui
Midi can be better, there are many duplicated actions
chord finder based in rules not comparing.
add chord generator, triad, 4 notes, extended chords (9, 10, 11th)
make music with it
